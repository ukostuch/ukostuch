### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a second-year student of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. I am interested in topics related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and neural networks. I participate in two scientific groups, where I explore information on these fields and develop practical skills.
